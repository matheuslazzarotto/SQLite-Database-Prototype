# SQLite-Database-Prototype

a prototype that me and [@LucasDfRocha](https://github.com/LucasdfRocha) are working on for a uni project, which consists in using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite to prototype a database that will store variables that are used in the calculation of a landslide.

_"loginEureka.py"_ is the main app containing the login page. It refers to _"eureka.py"_ which runs on the terminal when login is successful. 

_"eureka.py"_ refers to the database functions at _"functions.py"_

currently you can [1] show all lines, [2] delete a line, [3] add a line, [4] fetch a specific line and [5] fetch a value inside a specific line.

### to-do:
- index
- sort by fuction
- a less ugly GUI
- alter by line function
- alter by line/row function

shout-out to freeCodeCamp, whose [SQLite Databases With Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byHcYRpMgI4) course was extremely helpful. many thanks to some friends as well (Aleixo, Adolfo, Isaac and Erick)
