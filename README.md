# SQLite-Database-Prototype
A prototype that I'm working on for my uni project, 
which consists in using Python and SQLite to prototype a database that will store variables that are used in the calculation of a landslide. 
Many thanks to FreeCodeCamp, whose "SQLite Databases With Python" Course was essential for this project.

to use it:
1 - open Git Bash and enter cd/(directory of where the files are).

2 - enter 'python ourapp.py'.

Currently you can add, delete and show the full contents of the database.
