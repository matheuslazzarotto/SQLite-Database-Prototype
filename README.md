# SQLite-Database-Prototype

a prototype that @matheuslazzarotto and @LucasDfRocha are working on for a uni project, which consists in using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite to prototype a database that will store variables that are used in the calculation of a landslide.

"loginEureka.py" is the main app containing the login page. It refers to "eureka.py" which runs on the terminal when login is successful. 

"eureka.py" refers to the database functions at "functions.py"

currently you can [1] show all lines, [2] delete a line, [3] add a line, [4] fetch a specific line and [5] fetch a value inside a specific line.

### to-do:
- index
- sort by fuction
- a less ugly GUI
- alter by line function
- alter by line/row function

shout-out to freeCodeCamp, whose 'SQLite Databases With Python' course was extremely helpful. many thanks to some friends as well (Aleixo, Adolfo, Isaac and Erick)
