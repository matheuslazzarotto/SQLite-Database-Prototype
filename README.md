# SQLite-Database-Prototype
a prototype that I'm working on for my uni project, which consists in using Python and SQLite to prototype a database that will store variables that are used in the calculation of a landslide. Many thanks to FreeCodeCamp, whose "SQLite Databases With Python" Course was essential for this project. Currently you can add, delete and show the full contents of the database.

to start the application with the curreent application:

1 - open Git Bash and enter cd/(directory of where the files are).

2 - enter 'python ourapp.py'.

if you'd like to make a database yourself, you need to delete the 'customers.db' file and run creating_database.py on git.
