# SQLite-Database-Prototype

a prototype that me and [@LucasdfRocha](https://github.com/LucasdfRocha) are working on for a uni project, which consists in using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite to prototype a database that will store variables that are used in the calculation of a landslide.

_"loginEureka.py"_ is the main app containing the login page and it's own functions. It refers to _"eureka.py"_, the database app that runs on terminal when login is successful. all the database functions that _"eureka.py"_ uses are referred to _"functions.py"_
currently you can [1] show all lines, [2] delete a line, [3] add a line, [4] fetch a specific line and [5] fetch a value inside a specific line.

### to-do:
- index
- sort by fuction
- a less ugly GUI
- alter by line function
- alter by line/row function

shout-out to freeCodeCamp, whose [SQLite Databases With Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byHcYRpMgI4) course was extremely helpful. many thanks to some friends as well (Aleixo, Adolfo, Isaac and Erick)
